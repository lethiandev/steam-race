# Steam Race

​Get ready, put on seat belts, you're participating in a race, race of steam trains!

​Game made for `#godotjam` June 2018 edition. Unfinished and buggy prototype with a small multiplayer gameplay. The game is my first attempt to create a multiplayer game in the Godot Engine, at least, the networking code is still buggy and may cause some troubles.

In-game controls:
- <kbd>Left Arrow</kbd> - take a coal
- <kbd>Right Arrow</kbd> - put the coal to a steam engine

Indicators on the left shows current status of the steam engine and train's speed.

Have fun!
